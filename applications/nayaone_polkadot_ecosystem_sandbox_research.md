## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

*Connecting Polkadot Ecosystem with the global financial world*

The Polkadot Ecosystem Sandbox is a platform that brings together elements from both the NayaOne's Innovation Sandbox and Digital Sandbox to enable collaboration and accelerate the development and testing of Polkadot and 
related parachains specific projects and solutions for the global financial services market. It aims to connect innovators and developers in the Polkadot ecosystem with financial industry participants to drive the 
growth within the ecosystem and the industry.  

Building a hub for enterprises, financial institutions and industry regulators to develop regulatory compliant products using innovative technologies can be a complex and challenging endeavour. There are a number of 
considerations that need to be taken into account, including the specific regulatory environment in which the products will be used, the technological capabilities of the blockchain technologies, and the needs and 
due diligence requirements of the target customer base. It is important to establish strong partnerships and collaborations with key stakeholders in the industry, such as regulatory agencies and technology 
providers, in order to support the development and adoption of the products. Enterprises are also prioritizing the adoption of these technologies as they seek out new areas for growth and address industry-wide 
challenges. 

Through Digital Sandbox platform, NayaOne currently supports market innovators in the development of financial services through the creation of secure, dedicated digital testing environments in collaboration with 
industry regulators as well as financial institutions. These environments allow innovators to explore 'Proofs of Concept' (PoCs) and test their ideas in a controlled setting before bringing them to market. 

Currently, Digital Sandbox for industry regulators enable industry engagement through techsprints and digital testing environments. Platform contains the following components: 

1. API/Technology Marketplace – Hub for digital service providers to enable access to products via APIs. Innovators and developers can test multiple integrations using these Test APIs along with several existing service providers. 

2. Data Marketplace – Readily accessible synthetic and real data assets to enable testing, training and prototyping of new technology solutions. 

3. Integrated Developer Environments(IDEs) & Sandboxes – Enabling innovators and developers to write and test code collaboratively. 

4. Mentorship and support – Both from within the policy makers as well as from the industry. 

In addition to industry regulators, financial institutions and large enterprises are also using innovation sandboxes with the support of NayaOne, to collaborate with fintechs and other emerging technologies, 
facilitating rapid experimentation and the accelerated development of Proof of Concepts. In addition to API providers on the Technology Marketplace, The Innovation Sandbox for financial institutions and enterprises 
provides access to both SaaS products and cloud/on-prem deployable solutions, which can be tested and run easily through the platform. To ensure due diligence, these solutions are only available to institutions 
after a thorough review process. Anonymised and public data assets are also available through the Data Marketplace. Additionally, orchestration and governance layers allow the Institutions to collaborate more 
effectively and in a data driven manner.

Bringing together the components from both Regulator Digital Sandbox and Financial Institutions and Enterprises Innovation Sandbox, Polkadot Ecosystem Sandbox will consist of: 

1. Dot Hub – Collection of technologies, developer projects, infrastructure, decentralised finance applications, tooling from Polkadot/Substrate/Kusama/Acala and other related networks or parachains that would enable the broader financial industry innovation. 

2. Data Marketplace – Synthetic, On-chain data and other data assets that can support rapid experimentation and accelerated development. 

3. IDEs/Sandboxes - Enabling developers from fintech enterprises, institutions as well as from within the ecosystem to test and prototype applications, depending on the type of solutions such as SaaS, deployable solution, data based application or model etc. 

It can facilitate collaboration between community builders and creators within the Polkadot ecosystem and industry policy makers and financial industry participants. Innovators and developers in the ecosystem can 
also connect with the broader industry, enabling them to build compliant solutions and drive growth within the ecosystem. By bringing these stakeholders together, the sandbox aims to promote collaboration and drive 
innovation within the Polkadot ecosystem and the financial industry. 



### Project Details

#### Research
This research project aims to identify technology projects and data assets, infrastructure providers, decentralised finance applications, and tooling (including block explorers and security solutions) within the 
Polkadot ecosystem that could be well-suited for adoption by financial services industry participants and enterprises. NayaOne will conduct thorough due diligence to ensure that the projects and solutions included 
in the "Dot Hub" of the Polkadot Ecosystem Sandbox (as shown in Fig 1) are carefully evaluated and selected to support collaboration with industry stakeholders. The goal is to understand the potential for these 
solutions to be used by these stakeholders, and to determine how they might benefit from implementing them within their operations. 

It is also important to understand the various projects within the Polkadot ecosystem in order to identify how their solutions or technologies address the challenges and use cases relevant to financial industry 
participants, including regulators. By providing this information in the Dot Hub of the Polkadot Ecosystem Sandbox, users of the platform can gain a clear understanding of the solutions available and how they might 
be able to address specific needs or challenges. This can help to support informed decision-making and facilitate more effective collaboration within the ecosystem. 

Key points we'd like to explore as part of the research include but not limited to: 

1. Use cases 

2. Technology related information 

3. Due Diligence information gathering 

4. How can the users access the solution(API/SaaS/Cloud/On-Prem/other) 

5. Relevant data assets that can enable third party testing and integrations(if any) 

As the digital sandbox provider for industry regulators and financial services industry participants, NayaOne will use its tested approach and methodology, along with its due diligence solutions from the NayaOne 
platform, to conduct research on the projects within the Polkadot ecosystem. This research will help to identify which projects and solutions are well-suited for adoption by these stakeholders and how they might be 
able to address specific business challenges or needs.

### Ecosystem Fit

The Polkadot Ecosystem Sandbox is designed to not only enable developers and innovators within the ecosystem to build compliant projects that are relevant to the financial industry, but also to act as a container 
that can be deployed with specific orchestration and governance wrappers for Proof of Concept experimentation or industry engagement via techsprints or hackathons (as shown in Fig 2). It allows financial industry 
participants, such as regulators, institutions, industry bodies, and enterprises, to connect with projects within the Polkadot and parachains' ecosystems and engage in collaboration and experimentation. While 
blockchain-as-a-service platforms may offer some similar capabilities, the Polkadot Ecosystem Sandbox provides added benefits in terms of enabling more direct industry engagement and collaboration.
